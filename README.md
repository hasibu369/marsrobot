# About This Project

## Robot on Mars
This React application is designed to simulate the navigation of a robotic rover on a rectangular plateau situated on Mars, enabling its on-board cameras to capture a comprehensive view of the surroundings and transmit the images back to Earth.

The application allows users to move the robot on the plateau grid through commands, visualise its movements and final positions. The rover location is represented by a combination of x and y coordinates, with a letter that designates one of the four cardinal compass points.

For example, the rover position might be described as 1, 1, N, signifying its presence at the bottom left corner and facing North. 
     
Robot commands are: 
1.	“L” or left arrow - 90-degree left rotation 
2.	“R” or right arrow - 90-degree right rotation 
3.	'F' or up arrow - forward movement by one grid point
  
**Tech used:**
React, React Bootstrap
